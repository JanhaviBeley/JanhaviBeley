## Hey! I'm Janhavi 👋. (She/her)

I'm a Data Science and Analytics student studying in Boston. 

### Courses that I have taken and/or currently taking in this field;

- (CS 112) Introduction to Computer Science (Learnt Python Programming)
- (STAT228) Introduction to Data Science (Learning R Programming)

### Current Project?
I am currently working on my mini project 2 for the Introduction to Data Science Course.
I will be making a tutorial on Data Wrangling with a data set on Indian food that I found on Kaggle.

### ✨ Fun Facts
- As a kid, I wanted to go into the research medical field and study:
  1. Genetics; because I used to wonder how siblings looked so similar.
  2. Cancer; because I never understood the cause of it.
- I have completed Trinity College of London Piano exams till Grade 6.
- I feared joining a hackathon, so I decided to be on the committee and build a beginner-friendly hackathon.
- I enjoy going to weddings for food (who doesn't?)
